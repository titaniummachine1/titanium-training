//! pathfix/RaceProof — wall-aware exact race endgame solver (both hands empty).
//!
//! Port of `solveRaceConfig` from quoridor_5.html (gen11_ghi). With no walls
//! left in either hand the wall graph is fixed, so the pawn race is a finite
//! two-player game over 81×81×2 states. A retrograde ply-round fixpoint
//! assigns every forced state its exact value:
//!   tbl[(p0*81+p1)*2+turn]:  +k = side to move wins in k plies (optimal),
//!                            -k = side to move loses in k plies (slowest),
//!                             0 = unresolved by this table pass; caller must
//!                                 not treat it as a draw in Quoridor.
//! Successors come from the engine's own `gen_pawn_moves` on the CURRENT
//! blocked[] board, so jump rules match the search exactly.
